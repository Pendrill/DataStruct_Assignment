Welcome to Perfect Information BlackJack!

This is basically blackjack, however you and your opponent know exactly what each other have.
Quick refresher on the rules:

The sum of your cards need to get as close as possible to 21
numbered cards are worth their number
Jack Queen and Kings are worth 10
Aces are worth 1 or 11 based on the stituation, the game will change its value dynamically

If you and the dealer have the same value at the end, the dealer wins.
Essentially you are trying to beat the dealer.

You go first in asking for cards, once you stay, it will be the dealers turn
If you go above 21 you automatically lose.
